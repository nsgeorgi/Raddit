== Week 1 of my 12 in 12 Challenge

My goal with this challenge is to teach myself Ruby on Rails by building a new web app (using rails) each week for 12 weeks.

This week I built a link aggregator site, similar to Reddit or Hacker News, where a user can sign up, submit a link, as well as comment and vote up or down on link submissions.
